# test_mcp_registration.py

**Purpose:** Validate that the plugin's `.mcp.json` is well-formed, references binaries that resolve on disk, and uses server names that won't collide with other installed plugins.

## What problem does this solve?

Claude Code installs MCP servers per-plugin. When two plugins each register a server with the same bare name (e.g., `debugger`, `memory`, `search`), only one wins at runtime; the other is silently shadowed. There's no error message — the second plugin's MCP tools just don't appear under the qualified name the second plugin's authors thought they did.

The build-loop plugin and the standalone `claude-code-debugger` plugin both used to register a server named `debugger` in their respective `.mcp.json` files. Anyone who installed both got nondeterministic resolution. The fix landed in build-loop 0.8.2: rename the bundled server to `build-loop-debugger` so both can coexist. This test guards against a regression by failing the `ServerNamingHygiene` check if any future server name lacks a plugin-name prefix and matches a known collision-prone identifier.

The script also catches the broader category of "manifest looks fine but the binary it points at doesn't actually exist." A typical failure mode: someone changes a TypeScript build output path, or forgets to run `npm run build` before tagging a release. The plugin installs cleanly, but on first MCP call the runtime spawns `node` with a missing path, and the server crashes silently.

## How it works (algorithm)

The test module loads `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, follows its `mcpServers` field — which can be either an inline object or a string path to a separate `.mcp.json` — and runs four assertions:

1. **`ConfigShapeTests`** — the manifest declares `mcpServers` (or skips the test if not present); the referenced JSON parses; the parsed object has the expected `mcpServers` key with a dict value.
2. **`ServerNamingHygieneTests`** — for each server name, check it against a set of common collision-prone bare names (`debugger`, `memory`, `search`, `auth`, `logger`, `tracer`). If the plugin name is not a substring of the server name, the test "skips" with a hint. Skips are informational; many plugins use bare names today and the runtime doesn't block them. The skip is the warning.
3. **`CommandResolvesTests`** — for each server, expand `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` in its `args` array against the actual repo root, then assert any path-shaped argument (anything with a file extension) resolves to an existing file. Catches the missing-build-output failure mode.
4. **`NoDuplicateNamesTests`** — within this plugin's own `.mcp.json`, every server name is unique. JSON dict keys are inherently unique so this is a smoke check, but it's cheap insurance against a hand-edited config.

## Inputs and outputs

- **Inputs:** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and the `.mcp.json` it references.
- **Outputs:**
  - stdout: unittest output, including skips for absent artifacts.
  - exit code: 0 on pass-or-skip; non-zero on hard failure.
  - No filesystem side effects.

## Worked example

```bash
python3 scripts/test_mcp_registration.py
```

After the 0.8.2 rename, output:

```
test_command_args_resolve (...) ... ok
test_plugin_declares_mcp_or_skips (...) ... ok
test_referenced_mcp_file_valid_json (...) ... ok
test_unique_within_plugin (...) ... ok
test_server_names_avoid_common_unprefixed_names (...) ... ok

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 5 tests in 0.001s

OK
```

Before the rename, `test_server_names_avoid_common_unprefixed_names` would skip with:

```
SKIP: server name(s) ['debugger'] are not plugin-prefixed and may collide with another plugin registering the same name. Consider renaming to e.g. 'build-loop-debugger'. Non-blocking — many plugins use bare names today.
```

If a future change moved the server binary without updating `.mcp.json`:

```
AssertionError: server 'build-loop-debugger' references '${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/src/mcp/server.js' which resolves to /Users/.../dist/src/mcp/server.js — not present (run `npm run build` if TS source?)
```

## Edge cases and known limits

- **Inline vs file-form `mcpServers`:** both shapes are supported. The string form is the common one; the inline-object form (the manifest itself contains an `mcpServers` block) is occasionally used by smaller plugins.
- **Non-`node` commands:** the path-resolution check only fires when an arg looks like a path (has a file extension). A pure `python3 -m foo` invocation won't be checked.
- **Naming hygiene scope:** the bare-name list is intentionally short — only commonly-collisional generic names. Plugin-specific names like `bookmark` or `context7` aren't on the list because they're already plugin-uniqueish.
- **Skip vs fail:** ServerNamingHygiene uses `skipTest` rather than `assertTrue` because retrofitting every existing plugin to plugin-prefix server names is out of scope for this test. The skip is the warning. CI gates that want a blocking check should grep test output for `SKIP` or use the structured JSON output of the orchestrator's plugin-tests dispatch.

## Verification / how do we know it works

The 0.8.2 build-loop rename was bootstrapped against this test: pre-rename, the test skipped with the warning text shown above; post-rename, the test passes cleanly. The path-resolution check was verified by deliberately introducing a typo in `.mcp.json` (changing `dist/src` to `dst/src`) — the test failed with the expected error message, and once corrected, passed.
